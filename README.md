Tested the sample ReactREST backend example, replaced the original text file db
with the database created with sqlite3 command line, seems easy enough.

Next week maybe start working on building an user authentication system, and some
basic DB operations such as insert/delete etc.

This Ext-React seems pretty easy to understand, at least with the responsive-UI
part of it, maybe it will be hard once I get to the backend, will explore the 
backend tomorrow with the example provided.

The code for now is just the sample code generated when creating the project. 

Added a "Dev" tab in the NavMenu on the left, and added HoursTaken, HoursRemaining
columns, which the sample code somehow forgot to put in, to the Home table,
