Sample code and experiments of Sencha's ExtJS/ExtReact, with sample code from: https://github.com/sencha/extjs-reactor/tree/master/packages

Made a minimal user login/out with the ExtJS Rest example and sqlite3, most of the
ideas come from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23481817/node-js-passport-autentification-with-sqlite

Since React comes with the userAuth classes that can store session automatically and 
handle other userAuth, this is just an alternative that might come in handy if needed.

Tried redirecting the page to the employee info page that comes with the example, but 
doesn't quite work. 

Tomorrow maybe try load some data and put them in table form with sqlite3 and React.

Tested the sample ReactREST backend example, replaced the original text file db
with the database created with sqlite3 command line, seems easy enough.

Next week maybe start working on building an user authentication system, and some
basic DB operations such as insert/delete etc.

This Ext-React seems pretty easy to understand, at least with the responsive-UI
part of it, maybe it will be hard once I get to the backend, will explore the 
backend tomorrow with the example provided.

The code for now is just the sample code generated when creating the project. 

Added a "Dev" tab in the NavMenu on the left, and added HoursTaken, HoursRemaining
columns, which the sample code somehow forgot to put in, to the Home table,
